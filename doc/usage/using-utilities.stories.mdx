# Using Utilities

The CSS utilities are class names that can be used for very basic styling.

**When to use it?** You should use these utilities when your HTML element does
not have more than 3 lines of CSS to style it.

## Importing

```
@import '@kisskissbankbank/kitten/src/stylesheets/utilities';
```

## Using the utilities

### Media Queries

Some CSS utilities will have built-in media queries document width references in
 he form of a short breakpoint name and a direction (`up` or `down`).
The CSS rule of the utility will be embeded in the corresponding Media Query.

- `@xxs-up`
- `@xs-up`
- `@s-up`
- `@m-up`
- `@l-up`
- `@xl-up`


Equivalent to `@media (max-width: ___) {}`

- `@xxs-down`
- `@xs-down`
- `@s-down`
- `@m-down`
- `@l-down`

### Important

Adding `--important` at the end of any CSS utility will add `!important` at the
end of the CSS rule.
