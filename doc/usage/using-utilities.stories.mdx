# Using Utilities

The CSS utilities are class names that can be used for very basic styling.
These utility classes _are used by React Components_.
Kitten will not work properly without these utility classes.

## Importing

```
@import '@kisskissbankbank/kitten/src/stylesheets/utilities';
```

## Using the utilities

**When to use it?** You should use these utilities if you would need no more
than 3 lines of CSS to style your HTML element.

For example, instead of writing

```js
const FooBar = styled(props => (
  <div {...props}>
    Foo, bar, baz.
  </div>)
)`
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    margin-top: 10px;
  }
`
```

you should write

```js
const FooBar = props => (
  <div {...props} className="k-u-margin-top-single@s-up">
    Foo, bar, baz.
  </div>
)
```


### Media Queries

Some CSS utilities will have built-in media queries document width references in
 he form of a short breakpoint name and a direction (`up` or `down`).
The CSS rule of the utility will be embeded in the corresponding Media Query.

Equivalent to `@media (min-width: ___) {}`

- `@xxs-up`
- `@xs-up`
- `@s-up`
- `@m-up`
- `@l-up`
- `@xl-up`


Equivalent to `@media (max-width: ___) {}`

- `@xxs-down`
- `@xs-down`
- `@s-down`
- `@m-down`
- `@l-down`
- `@xl-down`

### Important

Adding `--important` at the end of any CSS utility will add `!important` at the
end of the CSS rule.
