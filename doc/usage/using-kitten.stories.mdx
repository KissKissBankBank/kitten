# Using Kitten

Kitten groups React components along with CSS utilities.

Old Sass-based components are being deprecated.

## Typography

Kitten is designed with one font in mind,
[Maax, by 205TF](https://www.205.tf/?search=Maax). Other font may be used,
but they might not fit with the vertical dimensions of Maax.
