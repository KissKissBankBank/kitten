# Using Kitten

Kitten groups React components along with CSS utilities.

Old Sass-based components are being deprecated.

## Typography

Kitten is designed with one font in mind,
[Maax, by 205TF](https://www.205.tf/?search=Maax). Other font may be used,
but they might not fit with the vertical dimensions of Maax.

## DevGrid

To better use the 12-cols Grid, Kitten incorporates a grid overlay utility.
Its name is DevGrid, and it can be imported as a React component.

```js
import { DevGrid } from '@kisskissbankbank/kitten'

…
  return (
    <DevGrid />
  )
…
```

When the component is present on the page, it can be invoked by pressing Ctrl-G
(like Control-Grid).
The upper left corner will show the current breakpoint, and the grid will be
superimposed on the page.
In the Kitten Storybook, DevGrid is present on all Stories, not no Docs pages.
